            Hello. We're Jude's, a family ice cream company dedicated to
            crafting unbelievably delicious stripey tubs of joy.
          </p>
          <p class="about-secondary">
            Our dad was starting an ice cream company. What began as a barely
            whispered idea was soon actually happening. He started small and set
            to work in our old barn at home in Hampshire. Our mum joined him and
            he decided to name the company after her. On 19th December 2002 he
            walked across the field to the village pub and sold the very first
            tub of Jude’s ice cream. We (Alex and Chow) soon realised that the
            ice cream was seriously good and were convinced it should be served

                The Ice Creams are fresh and really tasty. The staff is
                courteous too. The ice cream is not super sweet it is sweetened
                just sufficiently, the flavors very identifiable. Amidst the
                array of flavors, the season specials are THE best...

                I was excited to try this flavor and it was super delicious.The
                ice cream is truly incredible. The flavors are both Traditional
                Ice cream flavors and amazing uniquely Indian tastes.

                This is some of the best ice cream found in India. Everyone in
                our group loved it. Mango was the bomb dot com. Others likes
                coco crunch, coco almond.

                Will the ice cream be left on the doorstep if the recipient

              <p class="answer close-ans">
                Yes, the ice cream is packed with dry ice which keeps it frozen
                until 6pm on the day of delivery, so it’s not a problem if the
                person receiving your gift box is not at home.

              <p class="answer close-ans">
                The ice cream is packed with dry ice which keeps it cold until
                6pm on the day of delivery, so it should still be frozen when
                they get home.

              <p class="answer close-ans">
                6 x 460ml tubs of our utterly delicious ice cream takes up
                approximately as much space as a standard shoe box (not as much

                We have chosen to work with DPD as they have made a commitment
